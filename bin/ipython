# We'll trap and disable SIGINT (CTRL-C handling). IPython is typically
# exited by hitting CTRL-C twice (or more...). The second CTRL-C gets
# passed down to us. If this is a packed script, this CTRL-C (or one of 
# the subsequent ones) may interrupt the 'exit' that separated the
# body of the bash script and the embedded python code (see
# distrib/make_distrib.sh for details). When that happens, bash attempts
# to execute Python as bash and reports errors to the terminal. These are
# potentially confusing to the user.
#
# To avoid that, we trap CTRL-C at this point. We cannot disable it,
# however, as child processess inherid signal handlers, and if started 
# with SIGINT disabled they cannot it re-enable. We therefore trap it
# into a code snippet that disables it the first time it's caught (and
# it can only get caught once we've exited IPython, **or** if the user
# hits CTRL-C in the short interval between setting the trap and
# executing IPython (which is a race condition we'll have to live with).
